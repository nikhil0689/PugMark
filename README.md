The app is developed to facilitate analyzing real time data from the Forest guards who would go on foot patrolling. 
Real time data includes Forest fires, Death of Animals, Water level in various water tanks with location details etc. 
The app also has the feature of tracking the patrollers with their patrolling details like start of patrol time, 
end of patrol time and the distance they have covered. The real time data would enforce Forest department to take immediate actions 
and save our natural resources.
